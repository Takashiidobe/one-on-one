# Why take notes for 1 on 1s?

As an employee, 1 on 1s allow you to talk with your manager about things that happened, things you liked, things you didn't like, and things you noticed. All of these are important information to tell your manager and see if you can find a solution, or call out what is working and how to continue on that path.

Here are some questions to think about while taking notes for 1 on 1:

- What's something happening now that I'd like to change?
- Am I track for a promotion (if promotion is a goal of yours).
- Is there something about how the team is working that I like? Dislike? Would like to change?
- Is there too much support burden? How should we change that?
- Is there a particular part of the code that's giving me trouble? Why? How can we improve it?
- How is the my project going? Is it going well, meeting deadlines, or failing to meet deadlines? Do I feel like you align with the goals of the project, and why it's happening?
