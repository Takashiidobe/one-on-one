# Notes

- Currently working on project X, which adds a cache to the database layer of our web app for faster response time.
- The team is bikeshedding too much on whether or not to use redis or memcached, we should find a way to use one technology and stick with it.
- The Design doc we made for this is going well, but I feel like it's taking a while to resolve problems, and I'd like to have a senior developer's approval to move forward with implementation and interface docs.
- I've noticed our team is committing to a lot of toil grepping through server logs to check for this data, and I'd like to propose a quick SQL script that would aggregate this and display it in tabular data and ping us through PagerDuty.
